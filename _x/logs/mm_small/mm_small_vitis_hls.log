WARNING: Ignoring invalid XILINX_PATH location /opt/Xilinx/Vitis/2022.2_patch000034848/.
Resolution: An invalid XILINX_PATH location has been detected. To resolve this issue:

1. Verify the value of XILINX_PATH is accurate by viewing the value the variable via 'set XILINX_PATH' for Windows or 'echo $XILINX_PATH' for Linux, and update it as needed.

2. To unset the variable using on Windows using 'set XILINX_PATH=' or remove it from Advanced System Settings\Environment Variables. On Linux 'unsetenv XILINX_PATH'
